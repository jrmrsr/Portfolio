        <p className="main-text">> Engineers Without Borders is an organization that aims to fight systemic change and use
            design thinking to create solutions for problems like poverty, education, and sustainability.
            The focus of the chapter during my term as part of the executive team was aboriginal issues,
            as well as engineering advocacy. I helped start a podcast that interviewed students about campus
            issues, their experiences in engineering, as well as an open forum for the issues that EWB tackled.
            I also helped run outreach events at elementary schools and worked on getting the university Fair
            Trade certified.</p>
