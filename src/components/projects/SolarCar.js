        <p>> High performance vehicles were my introduction into engineering and my motivation in
          joining a vehicle design team. I joined Midnight Sun last summer and spent a lot of that 
          time helping build that yearâ€™s solar car and learning what it takes to build an efficient car. 
          This year, I am focusing on the structural composites that will make the chassis lighter and
          stiffer. The aim is to create a competitive car that is improved from last year, and have a 
          fair bit of fun along the way. </p>
