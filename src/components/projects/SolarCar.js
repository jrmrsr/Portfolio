        <p>> High performance vehicles were my introduction into engineering and my motivation in
          joining a vehicle design team. I joined Midnight Sun last summer and spent a lot of that 
          time helping build last yearâ€™s solar car and learning what it takes to build an efficient car. 
          This year, I am focusing on the structural composites that will make the chassis lighter and
          stiffer, as well as vehicle dynamics. The aim is to create a competitive car that is improved from last year, and have a 
          fair bit of fun along the way. <em>*The picture shows the car in action and was taken from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uwmidsun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midnight Sun Facebook Page</a>.</em></p>
